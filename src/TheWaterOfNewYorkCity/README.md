# Project 1: The Water of New York City
N.B.: you will lose 10 points if you use user input in your code.

Base Assignment (80 points):
In CS2, you likely encountered an ArrayList. You are not allowed to use those or arrays from above nor any other
existing, named structure in Java. Instead, you are to build a structure from scratch that achieves the following:

- `instantiate`: create an empty structure
- `add`: insert a single data point
- `remove`: eliminate a single data point by value
- `length`: determine the size of the structure in terms of data point count
- `﻿in`﻿: determine membership in the structure for a single data point

To drive decisions about your structure, we are interested in storing data regarding water consumption in New York City.

### Initiative (20 Points):

- Determine a question to pose about water consumption in NYC.
- Expand your structure with functionality to address your question and answer it.
- Document your process﻿ in a shared Google Doc 

### ﻿Submission:
We will be using GitHub for code submissions. Share the Google Doc with me.
